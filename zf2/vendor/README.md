Put ZF2's `Zend/` directory in here.

In this directory, you can put any third party ZF2 modules you want to use with
your ZF1 application. Of course, not all ZF2 modules will "just work" with ZF1
using ZF 2-for-1, but some simple modules should work just fine. As ZF 2-for-1
improves, more modules may become compatible.
